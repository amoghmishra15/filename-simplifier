## Requirements

* Windows: no prerequisites.
* Linux and Mac: Install python using your package manager or follow instruction on the [official website](https://www.python.org/).


## How to use


### Windows

Download the latest `simplify.exe` from the [releases](https://github.com/Az-21/filename-simplifier/releases).

**NOTE:** This file will take some 10-20 seconds to load on the first run. Furthermore, you might have to click on `run anyways` when prompted by Windows smartscreen. You can prevent the wait and confirmation if you follow the instructions in the upcoming section.

### Linux and Mac


[Download](https://github.com/Az-21/filename-simplifier/archive/master.zip) and extract the .zip.

\[Optional\] Or clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/Az-21/filename-simplifier.git`

Open up your terminal where you've cloned/extracted the `simplify.py` file and run filename simplifier using

```bash
python3 simplify.py
```

That's it! Everything is then done using [y/n] prompts

## Customization

Press `y` when prompted with `Edit settings? (y/n): `.

Currently you can customize

* Blacklisted words
* Extensions to work on (custom extensions)
* Various flags to enable/disable the `default` actions mentioned in the features earlier.

## Future of Project

I'm planning to reimplement filename-simplifier in C# with a GUI. .NET5 aims to be a cross-platform framework, so hopefully the .NET3 code should eventually become cross-platform. 

The python version works fine (and I use it regurlarly), but it will not recieve updates because I just cannot get my head around GUI in python. As of May 10, 2021, I've tried implementing GUI three times, but ended up scrapping it each time. Hopefully I get the motivation to pick up this project again.
